https://www.codechef.com/submit-v2/DPOLY

In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable x with N terms. The polynomial looks like A0⋅x0 + A1⋅x1 + … + AN−2⋅xN−2 + AN−1⋅xN−1 where Ai−1 denotes the coefficient of the ith term xi−1 for all (1≤i≤N).

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.
